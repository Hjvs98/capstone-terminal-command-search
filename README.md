Project Overview

This is my first full stack application. I have utilized javascript and express for most of the build. I have styled everything in css from scratch. It was created as a DevMountain Foundations Capstone. 

MVP

Knew I wanted to include the name of the command, description/ what the command does, if it is required or an optional command, parameters or any optional parameters, a page that organizes the commands in the db by week, a page that organizes the commands in the db by subject. Features section includes CRUD operations so that users can create a new command, update a current command, and delete a command. Custom styling that goes along with the devmountain brand. Also a way to conserve the current database by reseeding on home page load along with a button that will reseed the database for you.
